    <h1>Hypermedia</h1>
    <p>Hypermedia is an extension of the term hypertext, is a nonlinear medium of information that includes graphics, audio, video, plain text and hyperlinks. 
        This designation contrasts with the broader term multimedia, which may include non-interactive linear presentations as well as hypermedia. 
        It is also related to the field of electronic literature. The term was first used in a 1965 article written by Ted Nelson.[1][2]

        The World Wide Web is a classic example of hypermedia, whereas a non-interactive cinema presentation is an example of standard multimedia due to the absence of hyperlinks.
        
        The first hypermedia work was, arguably, the Aspen Movie Map. Bill Atkinson's HyperCard popularized hypermedia writing, while a variety of literary hypertext 
        and hypertext works, fiction and non-fiction, demonstrated the promise of links. Most modern hypermedia is delivered via electronic pages 
        from a variety of systems including media players, web browsers, and stand-alone applications (i.e., software that does not require network access).
         Audio hypermedia is emerging with voice command devices and voice browsing.[3]</p>
